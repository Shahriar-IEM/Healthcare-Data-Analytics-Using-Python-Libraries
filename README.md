# Healthcare-Data-Analytics-Using-Python-Libraries

Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains over 1.18 million rows and 34 columns. It includes information on various chronic diseases such as:

Asthma
Cancer
Cardiovascular Disease
Diabetes
Chronic Kidney Disease
Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD)
The dataset covers multiple U.S. states, years, and demographic groups, providing a comprehensive view of healthcare data.

Exploratory Data Analysis
We performed several steps of data exploration to understand the structure and characteristics of the dataset:

Initial Data Exploration: Summarized data statistics, column details, and data types.
Handling Missing Data: Cleaned the dataset by filling missing values and dropping irrelevant columns.
Visualizing Trends: Plotted trends over time, demographic distributions, and geographic differences.


Visualizations
Some of the key visualizations created in this project include:

Mortality Rates for Chronic Diseases Over Time: A line plot showing trends in mortality rates across different chronic diseases from 2010 to 2020.
Geographical Variations: Bar plots comparing mortality rates for chronic diseases across U.S. states.
Mortality Rates by Gender: A comparison of mortality rates between male and female populations for diseases like cancer.
Correlation Matrix: A heatmap visualizing correlations between mortality rates of chronic diseases such as diabetes and cardiovascular diseases.


Key Findings
Increasing Trends: The analysis shows increasing mortality rates for diseases like cancer and cardiovascular disease over the years.
Geographic Disparities: Significant differences in mortality rates between states, with some regions having much higher rates for specific diseases.
Gender and Age Impact: Mortality rates vary significantly by gender and age group, with older adults and males showing higher rates for certain diseases.


Technologies Used
Python: Data analysis and visualization.
pandas: Data manipulation and exploration.
matplotlib & seaborn: Visualization libraries for creating charts and plots.
NumPy: Numerical operations.
